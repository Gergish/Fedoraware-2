Put the compiled dll in releases pls

Fedora A free and open-source training software for Team Fortress 2, based on [SE-Owned](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/team-fortress-2-a/436430-seowned-featured-cheat.html).

## Guide

- We suggest using [Fedoraloader](https://github.com/Fedoraware/Fedoraloader/releases) as it downloads the latest build and injects it with minimal crashing. It also includes a VAC bypass.
- Alternatively, use an injector like [Xenos](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos/releases) to inject the dll into TF2. [(Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT3kVA053IY)
- **If you have any suggestions for the cheat, or questions about it, you can open a thread in [discussions](https://github.com/Fedoraware/Fedoraware/discussions).**
- **If you have any problems, you can open an [issue](https://github.com/Fedoraware/Fedoraware/issues).**
